In time he fashioned a ring of exceptional beauty, but his efforts to find the required inscription were in vain. Walking in the palace garden one day searching his heart for just the right words, he met up with young Solomon. He decided to ask for the advice of one already noted for his wisdom. \"\"What can I possibly inscribe upon a ring that will moderate the king's ecstasy and at the same time lift him up when he falls despondent? How would you answer that riddle?\"\" \"\"Inscribe upon the ring,\"\" said Solomon, \"\"these words. 'THIS TOO SHALL PASS AWAY.' When the king will gaze upon it in triumph it will reduce his pride. When he will behold it in despair and trouble it will lift up his spirits and encourage his weary heart.\"\" All of us should wear a ring like that because it reminds us that our attitude towards life makes a tremendous difference. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty - a pessimist sees a difficulty in every opporturnity.\","
